As the cream of female film talent, including Hollywood’s Meryl Streep and Britain’s Andrea Arnold, prepare to receive significant career awards, a dark cloud is threatening. It is expected that new allegations of the abuse of women in the European entertainment industry will be made public, which may overshadow the sparkle of a feminist Croisette.Streep’s screen achievements will be celebrated with an honorary Palme d’Or at the opening ceremony, while a day later Arnold, the acclaimed British film director, will receive the prestigious Carosse d’Or from the French director’s guild. And on Sunday another influential British film personality will be saluted when diversity champion Dame Donna Langley, the chairman and chief content officer at NBCUniversal, is to be honoured with the Women in Motion Award at a lavish dinner. All this comes in a year that also sees the American director Greta Gerwig, best known for last summer’s Barbie, presiding over a jury that features the campaigning stars Eva Green and Lily Gladstone. But the story of the 77th festival will not be all positive for women.

How to embrace Japan’s micro-seasons in your own garden,"Observing fleeting seasonal changes goes hand in hand with gardening  – and bring about a profound sense of calmIn Japan, people eat, sleep and wear the seasons, from elegant kimono motifs to petal-shaped sweets and festivals dedicated to nature’s spectacular displays. Unlike its western equivalent, Japan’s ancient agricultural calendar is governed not solely by the waxing and waning of the moon and the sun’s position in the sky, but also by the blooming of seasonal flowers and other small changes in nature against the wider backdrop of the seasons.According to the traditional Japanese almanac, the year is divided into four major seasons, 24 sekki (solar terms), and 72 kō, or micro-seasons. Each kō lasts only five days and is associated with specific seasonal rituals, foods, flowers and festivals.

I loved him enormously. But he was a liar. I grew up in Inverness where my father Mateusz was a well-liked tailor. He was also a refugee with an East European accent who had fled his village in south-east Poland during the second world war.Dad had always been a bit vague about his past but I figured that, like many of his generation, he didn’t like talking about the war. It was only when I went to his home village in 2003, now in western Ukraine, that I discovered the stories my father told us about his early years were just that, stories. He told lies about his religion, his family and what he did during the war: they just tumbled out, one after the other.

Relentless Pep Guardiola’s laser focus gives Manchester City cutting edge | John Brewin,"Josko Gvardiol is the latest example of how the Catalan’s reinvention of his players has created a title-winning machineToo good, too strong, and the inevitable draws ever closer. Their fans’ “we’re not really here” chant may be soaked in deepest Manc irony but it also reflects the economic miracle of Manchester City being the best team in England by far. After victory at Fulham the unknown is about to be breached. Four league titles in a row is a level the greatest teams in English history – Huddersfield in the 1920s, Arsenal in the 1930s, Liverpool in the 1980s and two Alex Ferguson-era Manchester United teams – could not attain.Success earns respect if not necessarily affection. Each of those predecessors found a way to win that did not achieve universal admiration. Within living memory, Liverpool were derided for overuse of the back-pass to the point of tedium. United were loathed for being the personification of Ferguson’s cheerlessness. The Manchester City of 2024 are – beyond the ongoing legal issues that overshadow their glory – dismissed as too surgical, almost too perfect.

A dearth of priests suggests the Catholic church should widen recruitment | Julian Coman,"It’s no wonder numbers training for the priesthood continue to fall when married men or any woman are still barredWalking down towards the River Nidd in Knaresborough, the pretty North Yorkshire market town where I grew up, it would be easy to pass by St Mary’s Catholic church without noticing it. Built only two years after the Emancipation Act in 1829, the church was designed to resemble a private house in order not to offend local Protestant sensibilities. Two centuries later, sectarian sentiment is no longer a problem, but the crisis of vocations in the church certainly is.Back in Knaresborough, over the bank holiday weekend, I was in the Sunday morning congregation to hear Father William pass on sad news. A letter from the bishop of Leeds informed us that when William returns to Ampleforth Abbey, after 12 years’ sterling work, he will not be replaced by a resident priest. Instead, the parish will share one with a church in nearby Harrogate. Inevitably, that will mean fewer masses, and it is hard to imagine that the new man (because, of course, it will be a man), will be able to devote the same level of pastoral care and attention to the town.

ChatGPT and the like will co-pilot coders to new heights of creativity | John Naughton,"Far from making programmers an endangered species, AI will release them from the grunt work that stifles innovationWhen digital computers were invented, the first task was to instruct them to do what we wanted. The problem was that the machines didn’t understand English – they only knew ones and zeros. You could program them with long sequences of these two digits and if you got the sequence right then the machines would do what you wanted. But life’s too short for composing infinite strings of ones and zeros, so we began designing programming languages that allowed us to express our wishes in a human-readable form that could then be translated (by a piece of software called a “compiler”) into terms that machines could understand and obey.Over the next 60 years or so, these programming languages – with names such as Fortran, Basic, Algol, COBOL, PL/1, LISP, C, C++, Python – proliferated like rabbits, so that there are now many hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of them. At any rate, it takes quite a while to scroll down to the end of the Wikipedia page that lists them. Some are very specialised, others more general, and over the years programmers created libraries of snippets of code (called subroutines) for common tasks – searching and sorting, for example – that you could incorporate when writing a particular program.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes review – thrilling addition to the series,"Wes Ball brings fresh blood, new ideas and superb motion capture to this top-quality summer blockbusterWith this muscular instalment of the consistently impressive rebooted Apes franchise, director Wes Ball, previously best known for the propulsive but somewhat generic YA dystopian Maze Runner series, graduates, with honours, to the big league of Hollywood helmers. This is a top-quality summer blockbuster, bringing fresh blood and new ideas into the series while staying recognisably within the worlds so meticulously created in the previous three movies.Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is set many generations in the future, long after the events of War for the Planet of the Apes and the conclusion of the story of Caesar, who is now regarded as a Moses-like legendary figure. But the thing about legends is that they get appropriated and twisted to fit the current narrative. Wise old orangutan scholar Raka (Peter Macon) follows the word of Caesar to the letter; Proximus (Kevin Durand) cherrypicks the primate unity theme but disregards the bit about ape not killing ape. And youngster Noa (Owen Teague), son of the leader of a chimp clan that trains and hunts with eagles, hasn’t even heard of Caesar.In UK and Irish cinemas now Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/11/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review-thrilling-addition-to-the-series,2024-05-11 14:00:29,"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a top-quality summer blockbuster, bringing fresh blood and new ideas into the series while staying recognisably within the worlds so meticulously created in the previous three"
Olivia Rodrigo review – shiny pop-punk with real guts,"Ovo Hydro, GlasgowThere’s no doubt the former Disney actor is a pro, but she’s also a deft, sincere songwriter who captures the viewpoint of a teen outsider to perfectionPop music made by child actors doesn’t often feature axe duels and headbanging. But tonight, during a song called Obsessed, gen-Z phenomenon Olivia Rodrigo, wielding an electric guitar, faces off against one of her guitarists, Emily Rosenfield, as the rest of the band build a grungy din around them.Pop vocalists often perform facsimiles of rock-in-inverted-commas quite egregiously, foregrounding obnoxious guitar solos. Rodrigo’s band is made up entirely of women and non-binary musicians – a rarity at any level, let alone in arenas. And unlike most bands tacked on to the back of a singer, these musicians don’t wave devil’s horns while gurning. They just play loud and fast, their showboating gleeful rather than clichéd. All the young kids here will hopefully take all this for granted.

Deborah Levy: ‘Writing and swimming help each other’,"The novelist and memoirist on stamina and solitude, the influence of surrealist art on her work, and Pier Paolo Pasolini’s revelatory travel writingDeborah Levy’s books include three memoirs and eight novels, half of them published between 1989 and 1999, the other half since 2011, when her Booker-shortlisted Swimming Home came out with a small startup press after rejection by traditional publishers. For the Times Literary Supplement, her novels “teem with oddness, with dreamlike, vertiginous scenes … [and characters] in search of a haunting from their past”. When she was again shortlisted for the Booker in 2016 with Hot Milk, a judge said the novel’s “symbolic richness and mythic complexity ... is also underpinned by a wicked humour: it’s like Virginia Woolf with good jokes”. Levy, 64, spoke from her home in London about her most recent novel, August Blue, in which a classical pianist meets her doppelganger while having a breakdown amid the pandemic.How does a novel start life for you?An idea or feeling won’t go away.

Yotam Ottolenghi’s five-ingredient (or thereabouts) recipes,"A simple, one-tray take on Hainanese chicken rice, heady with ginger and topped with a spring onion oil, and braised broad beans in their pods with chilli and garlicSetting ourselves a five-ingredient limit on any recipe really gets the Ottolenghi test kitchen going. Well, that, or it sends us spiralling into existential doubt, not least regarding what, exactly, constitutes an ingredient. Everyone has salt and pepper, right, so we don’t need to include them in the tally? What about white pepper: is that the same? Water’s not an ingredient, either – it’s not something we need to go out and buy. But does that mean tinfoil is? Can we squeeze in olive oil on a free pass? Or garlic? And what if something is just a serving suggestion, rather than a built-in part of the recipe? How about we just put every ingredient in the title, to highlight how simple and short the ingredient list is? For a group of recipe-creating obsessives, never has counting to five felt so confusing. The results, though, I’m happy to report, are delightfully straightforward, uncomplicatedly delicious and serve (well, about) five.

On their second, she found someone who would wait for her, no matter whatThe odds that Mike and I would ever meet were low. We both grew up in Perth – the only problem being he was in Perth, Scotland, and I was in Perth, Western Australia. We then managed to find ourselves living in the same place (Melbourne) but on different sides of the city an hour’s drive apart.It was 2014, we’d both been divorced for about five years and neither of us was having much luck with internet dating. It didn’t help that my online profile was set to only show matches who lived within a 5km radius of my house. So while I really wanted to find love, I apparently wasn’t willing to look further than walking distance from my front door. The algorithm very sensibly ignored me and matched me with Mike. I was intrigued by his profile; his heading was: “Looking for a woman who can make me laugh.” In my experience, men usually want to be the funny ones, the centre of attention.

Ciarán Hinds: ‘I’m not very good at the glamorous side of the industry’,"The actor, 71, on rubbing shoulders with Hollywood’s finest, his Belfast upbringing – and why he’s made a decision to work a bit lessI was the only boy of five and my sisters would have said I was a spoiled child. It didn’t feel like it – they went off to a convent school and I was left at home in Belfast to do the hoovering with my mother. Every boy back then was trying to be George Best, so I was always out kicking a football. We were Catholic, but not furiously strict. I was even an altar boy for a while.I was still at school when the Troubles started in 1969. We lived in a mixed area and weren’t targeted, but you were very aware of explosions, and while it was fearful and dangerous, it was also weirdly exciting. There was something electric in the air for a kid who didn’t understand mortality yet.I did Irish dance from the ages of six to 19 and became quite proficient at it. Our teacher, Patricia Mulholland, was a great classical violinist and would play traditional tunes while we danced. Schools were segregated, but Patricia believed dancing was for everyone, so we were a mixed community. That was a great opening for me.There was some trepidation at home about me becoming an actor, so I studied law at Queen’s University Belfast. One of my tutors was someone I’d been in a school production of Macbeth with years before. He could tell I was in no way interested in law and suggested I study theatre. I got a grant and went to Rada, and my parents were supportive.I met Liam Neeson at Dublin airport when we were teenagers who’d both been selected to do a theatre experience in Holland. We were the only two northerners, and we bonded because we’d just seen Midnight Cowboy and were knocked out by it. We became very close friends and still are.I’m a very day-to-day person. I don’t think of my career in terms of a progression. I do projects that excite me. If you want to be a Hollywood star, you have to have that ambition as part of your DNA. I just don’t have it. That’s why I bounce from place to place.I met my wife [actor Hélène Patarot] in 1987 when we were both in Peter Brook’s The Mahabharata. She is French-Vietnamese, we live in Paris and London.

"Soya, nuts and yoghurt: the diet tweaks that can ease the symptoms of menopause","It’s crucial to look after your gut microbiome. So avoid ultra-processed foods,  eat healthily, and try blueberries and beetroot for help with hot flushes tooWhen life feels chaotic, food can be a comfort, a pleasure, an uplifting ritual. Fitting in time to cook, however, can often seem like another impossible thing on the list, especially when there are differing tastes to cater for, and the demands of work to contend with. But as women enter their fourth and fifth decades, considering what we eat is crucial, and making just a few tweaks may improve our health and wellbeing.“The focus needs to be on eating well, eating a variety of foods, and foods that support bone and heart health,” says Dr Claire Phipps, GP and advanced menopause specialist. Think about a Mediterranean style of eating, with lots of oily fish, wholegrain, pulses, fruit and veg, good fats (avocado, olive oil, for example), nuts and seeds, protein and dairy (calcium is vital for supporting bone density). Good health at this stage of life really is best achieved through diet rather than supplements – “our body uses it much better”. That said, Phipps would recommend taking a vitamin D supplement, maybe magnesium, as “it can be helpful for insomnia”.

AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine is no more – but its remarkable success must not be forgotten | Robin McKie,"Although dogged by controversy, the firm’s coronavirus jab saved the lives of millions and helped avert humanitarian crises in nations unable to access costly alternativesLast week’s announcement that AstraZeneca would no longer market its Covid vaccine brings an end to one of the century’s most remarkable medical stories. Created within a year of the arrival of the pandemic, the AZ vaccine was cheap, easily stored and transported, and helped stave off humanitarian crises in Asia and Latin America, where many countries could not afford the more expensive mRNA vaccines that were being snapped up by rich western nations. It is estimated that it saved 6.3 million lives in 2021 alone.Yet from the start the vaccine – created by research teams led by Professor Andy Pollard and Professor Sarah Gilbert at the Oxford Vaccine Centre – was dogged by controversy. It was linked to blood clots, US observers criticised protocols for its trials, and French president Emmanuel Macron claimed it was “quasi-ineffective” for people over 65. In fact, the vaccine is particularly effective for the elderly.

"Human rights lawyer Susie Alegre: ‘If AI is so complex it can’t be explained, there are areas where it shouldn’t be used’","The author of Human Rights, Robot Wrongs on why AI isn’t an all-or-nothing equation, separating hype from genuine dangers, and discovering that ChatGPT says she doesn’t existSusie Alegre is an international human rights lawyer and author, originally from the Isle of Man, whose focus in recent years has been on technology and its impact on human rights. As a legal expert she has advised Amnesty International, the UN and other organisations on issues such as counter-terrorism and anti-corruption. Her first book, Freedom to Think, published in 2022 and shortlisted for the Christopher Bland prize, looked at the history of legal freedoms around thought. In her new book Human Rights, Robot Wrongs, she turns her attention to the ways in which AI threatens our rights in areas such as war, sex and creativity – and what we might do to fight back.What prompted you to write this book?There were two triggers. One was the sudden explosion of ChatGPT and the narrative about how everyone can be a novelist now and there’s going to be no need for human creators, because AI will be able to do it all for us. It felt utterly depressing. The second was the story about a Belgian man who took his own life after a six-week intensive relationship with an AI chatbot. His widow felt that, without this relationship, which distorted his worldview, he would have still been there for her and for his children. That triggered me to think – well, this is absolutely about the right to life; to family life, to freedom of thought and freedom from manipulation. And how are we thinking about AI and the really severe ways that it’s impacting our human rights?Human Rights, Robot Wrongs by Susie Alegre is published by Atlantic Books (£12.99).

‘The issue is when to pull the trigger’: how prepared are we for human bird flu?,"The H5N1 virus has been devastating bird populations, and is now infecting mammals too. Is human-to-human transmission next? And are we ready for another pandemic?Over the past four years, a silent pandemic has been raging. One in which the death toll is believed to number in the hundreds of millions, but which has received remarkably little attention until now.The pandemic in question is bird flu, the H5N1 strain of influenza, which since 2020 has moved far beyond the avian world and into mammals ranging from dairy cattle to domestic pets, and species that live on our doorsteps, such as foxes. The virus’s presence has been detected on every continent, even Antarctica. While it has yet to evolve the capability of spreading between humans, alarm bells were raised last month after a dairy farm worker in Texas contracted H5N1, seemingly from cattle.

Eco-brutalism: when angular concrete meets the wonder of nature – in pictures,"On her @brutalistplants Instagram page, Olivia Broome collects photographs that combine the angular shapes of raw concrete with the greenery of the natural world. “I really enjoy the aesthetic of eco-brutalism and tropical modernism,” she says. “I love mezzanines and ziggurats, and when you pair them with plants it softens them up. Brutalism can be this quite harsh, austere architecture style, but with nature involved, it balances it all out.” Now collected in a book, the images bring together buildings from across the globe, from Hong Kong to Sri Lanka, London to Mexico. “It’s a pleasant movement that people can get behind, especially in smaller spaces and modern cities – it’s nice to fill them with plants and nature.” • Brutalist Plants (Hoxton Mini Press, £20) will be published on Thursday Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/may/11/eco-brutalism-when-angular-concrete-meets-the-wonder-of-nature-in-pictures,2024-05-11 16:00:30,"Olivia Broome’s Brutalist Plants brings together buildings from across the globe, from Hong Kong to Sri Lanka, in a style that balances nature and architecture"

Relentless Pep Guardiola’s laser focus gives Manchester City cutting edge | John Brewin,"Josko Gvardiol is the latest example of how the Catalan’s reinvention of his players has created a title-winning machineToo good, too strong, and the inevitable draws ever closer. Their fans’ “we’re not really here” chant may be soaked in deepest Manc irony but it also reflects the economic miracle of Manchester City being the best team in England by far. After victory at Fulham the unknown is about to be breached. Four league titles in a row is a level the greatest teams in English history – Huddersfield in the 1920s, Arsenal in the 1930s, Liverpool in the 1980s and two Alex Ferguson-era Manchester United teams – could not attain.Success earns respect if not necessarily affection. Each of those predecessors found a way to win that did not achieve universal admiration. Within living memory, Liverpool were derided for overuse of the back-pass to the point of tedium. United were loathed for being the personification of Ferguson’s cheerlessness. The Manchester City of 2024 are – beyond the ongoing legal issues that overshadow their glory – dismissed as too surgical, almost too perfect.

Arsenal capitalise on Arteta’s belief in set-piece specialism – unlike Spurs | Jonathan Wilson,"Set plays are giving Gunners an edge, yet Ange Postecoglou’s weak spot is not singling them out for specialist coachingAnge Postecoglou isn’t worried about set pieces, as he has made clear repeatedly over the past few weeks. Football being football, the more he is asked and the more he plays down their importance, the more goals Spurs seem to concede from set pieces. At the same time, as Arsenal score more and more from set pieces, their set-piece coach, Nicolas Jover, has become an increasingly prominent figure, bouncing up from the bench every time Arsenal are awarded a corner or free-kick near the box.Set pieces feel like the new frontier. It may look familiar as Declan Rice bends one in, Ben White checks the keeper and a phalanx of big blokes charge to the near post, but the blocking runs are more carefully plotted that ever before.

Exeter’s back row were again conspicuously forceful, with Ethan Roots and Greg Fisilau both excellent, and the Chiefs – who won the second-half 37-5 – also had the thrillingly dynamic Immanuel Feyi-Waboso who added two more tries and several big linebreaks to his increasingly striking portfolio.

Outsider Ambiente Friendly defies odds to stun favourite Illinois in Derby Trial,"Colt is now in to 12-1 from 100-1 to triumph in Epsom ClassicYou Got To Me beats Rubies are Red in Oaks Trial at LingfieldOne of the aspects of the two-week run of Classic trials after the Guineas meeting at Newmarket that makes it so much fun is that you can never be entirely sure when a realistic – and previously unconsidered – contender for the Derby or Oaks will suddenly throw their hat into the ring. Ambiente Friendly was a 100-1 shot for the Derby before the Lingfield Derby Trial but he is now no bigger than 12-1 after a powerful run down the middle of the track saw him stride nearly five lengths clear of Illinois, the Aidan O’Brien-trained 6-4 favourite, at the line.O’Brien for one will probably have better Derby candidates in his yard than his runner here but there was no hint of fluke about Ambiente Friendly’s success.

England’s summer tour of Japan and New Zealand will surely include the 21-year-old Exeter Chiefs wing, who won his first four caps during the Six Nations. His opening three appearances came from the bench, and featured a try against Scotland, but his starting debut, as England ruined Ireland’s grand slam ambitions, provided the most substantial evidence of his composure and talent.He offers engaging company but is also different to most modern rugby players. After admitting it would be “the stuff of dreams” to play against the All Blacks, and perhaps score a try in Dunedin or Auckland, the medical student moves on to a weighty subject.

I know that this was his first game and whatever, but it is true that we were very affected today,” said Iraola. “For the second one, the referee has made a mistake because he called a foul and two seconds later we scored. He should have waited to whistle until we scored otherwise the VAR cannot overturn it.” Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/11/bournemouth-brentford-premier-league-match-report,2024-05-11 16:47:25,Yoane Wissa’s dramatic stoppage-time goal handed Brentford victory over Bournemouth after an action-packed 2-1 victory at the Vitality Stadium....

Will Oldham on Steve Albini: ‘He elevated the quality of the human experience’,"The artist known as Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy met the late musician as a 15-year-old fan, and became a creative partner and friend. He explains why Albini’s idealism is more needed than everI met Steve Albini in 1985, when I was 15 years old. Me and some friends had driven up to northern Kentucky to see Big Black perform at a club, which we had to create fake IDs for. Afterwards, Big Black, myself and a couple of other folks from Louisville all retired to the same apartment to sleep on couches and floors, which was the thrill of a lifetime – to be in their company after they’d blown us away. We were more properly introduced in the morning and Steve recognised my name as somebody who had sent him a cheque for a record and T-shirt: “Will Oldham, I owe you a T-shirt!” A T-shirt I still have today, which my wife wears sometimes.Big Black did these song concept sheets instead of lyric sheets – a blob of text that was not the lyrics, but prose that augmented the experience of listening to the songs. Which I still find to be wonderful and unique. And it’s a good example of the way Steve would approach things, in kind of a beneficently deconstructive fashion. He had the inclination to question – and to question with the idea that if you’re going to ask a question, you need to be prepared with something resembling a workable answer. Steve had the idea that there’s no end to the amount of work you can put into your music, and that it can be fun! That the work doesn’t have to be just gruelling and harsh. The making and playing of music, the recording and distributing of music, and the design of the covers – those are the infrastructure on which we can base our friendships.

Doctor Who: even the haters will find it impossible to resist Ncuti Gatwa,"The Fifteenth Doctor is magnetic and charming as he flashes great knowing smiles and explains sci-fi nonsense elegantly. Consider me a convert! Doctor Who is back and there’s a new Doctor and a new assistant and Russell T Davies is back doing it and there’s a new Tardis and there’s a new Sonic Screwdriver, too. This information is either the most important thing you’ve received in five years or it means absolutely nothing to you. You are either a Doctor Who person or you are not, and that is OK. Here’s a word I gleaned from the first episode and checked through the many, many embargoes to ensure I am allowed to say it in print: “Gallifrey”. Did that mean anything to you? If “yes”, you’re going to have a very exciting weekend.I want to be cynical about Doctor Who (11 May, 6.20pm, BBC One), I want to ruin my next week by receiving really long emails from the people who watch it (“Dear Sir, Ncuti Gatwa is in fact the Fifteenth Doctor, not – as stated in your laughable screed dated 11 May! – the Fourteenth. David Tennant’s three-episode reappearance was as a separate incarnation of the Doctor to the Tenth he played for 47 episodes between 2005 and 2010.”). I want to say mean things like: “Doctor Who is a series I would show to my dog if I was trying to make him smarter.” But, sadly, I sat down with a big bowl of cereal and my nice headphones on, watched the first two episodes of the new series and was dreadfully, inevitably, embarrassingly charmed by it.

Glasgow’s burned-out marvel: will the restoration of Mackintosh’s School of Art ever happen?,"People wept in the street when the magnificent Mackintosh building was nearly destroyed by two fires. So why, 10 years on and despite overwhelming support for restoration, is there still no plan – or funding – for its repair?Where to start with the Mackintosh building of the Glasgow School of Art? With its fearless originality? With its ability to run many gamuts – dark, light, massive, intimate, crafted, industrial, refined, rough, its spaces long, narrow, high and wide, its conversion of Glaswegian manufacturing wealth into a hilltop castle of art of Scottish baronial might and Japanese-inspired delicacy? Its handling of the things that make architecture beautiful – materials, proportion, detail, ornament, structure, light, contrast – was consummate. It worked magic with stone, iron, oak, stained glass and bent tin, enamel and electric lights, with engineering borrowed from shipyards and with skinny tendrils of plant-like ornament that teetered on the edge of kitsch. It had the nerve to be completely different on every elevation, confident that it would cohere by force of the imagination.It was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who was 29 when he started work on it, and built in two phases from 1897 to 1899 and 1907 to 1909. There has never been another building like it, in Scotland or indeed the United Kingdom, for combining invention with impact, for leading rather than following international architecture. Unlike many of our historic monuments, it still performed the purpose for which it was designed: it combined exquisite craftsmanship with plain boarding on its studios’ walls that could take the battering that art students would inflict on it. It was, as Brad Pitt told the BBC, “an artistic building where art is made and art is learned”. In Peter Capaldi’s words it was “an exotic place of the imagination… a part of me, and of all Glaswegians.” Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/article/2024/may/11/glasgow-mackintosh-school-of-art-fire-restoration-funding-repair,2024-05-11 15:00:30,"The Mackintosh building of the Glasgow School of Art was nearly destroyed by fire 10 years ago and despite overwhelming support for restoration, there still no plan or funding for its repair"
Beabadoobee: ‘I don’t have time for death threats. I’ve got a mortgage to pay’,"A support slot on Taylor Swift’s Eras tour and a Rick Rubin produced album has given the former TikTok-viral musician a new sense of self-confidence. Not even the internet trolls can stop herAbout a year ago, Beatrice Laus, AKA Beabadoobee, started taking ballet lessons. The acclaimed, perpetually TikTok-viral indie rock musician had been touring hard in 2022, and began to feel her body breaking down. Like most early-20s musicians – or twentysomethings in general – she was, at that time, “very mentally and physically unfit, and doing a lot of bad things to my body”. Eventually, she realised she needed to get herself in shape. “I’m a very weak human being – my immune system is very weak, so I just had to build that up,” she recalls, speaking from her west London bedroom. As for why she picked ballet, specifically? “I thought the outfits were cute,” she says, with a self-aware sheepishness. “Like, I’m trying to be real!”Self-improvement has been on the mind a lot for Laus over the past year. Her third album, This Is How Tomorrow Moves, due for release this summer, is a huge leap forward, finding her dealing with “the confusing world of becoming a woman and becoming an adult” with wit, honesty and grace. Co-produced by her longtime collaborator Jacob Bugden and pop music sage Rick Rubin at his Malibu studio Shangri-La, it’s a record that sees Laus trying to convey “a sense of confidence that I finally accepted within myself”.

Olivia Rodrigo review – shiny pop-punk with real guts,"Ovo Hydro, GlasgowThere’s no doubt the former Disney actor is a pro, but she’s also a deft, sincere songwriter who captures the viewpoint of a teen outsider to perfectionPop music made by child actors doesn’t often feature axe duels and headbanging. But tonight, during a song called Obsessed, gen-Z phenomenon Olivia Rodrigo, wielding an electric guitar, faces off against one of her guitarists, Emily Rosenfield, as the rest of the band build a grungy din around them.Pop vocalists often perform facsimiles of rock-in-inverted-commas quite egregiously, foregrounding obnoxious guitar solos. Rodrigo’s band is made up entirely of women and non-binary musicians – a rarity at any level, let alone in arenas. And unlike most bands tacked on to the back of a singer, these musicians don’t wave devil’s horns while gurning. They just play loud and fast, their showboating gleeful rather than clichéd. All the young kids here will hopefully take all this for granted.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes review – thrilling addition to the series,"Wes Ball brings fresh blood, new ideas and superb motion capture to this top-quality summer blockbusterWith this muscular instalment of the consistently impressive rebooted Apes franchise, director Wes Ball, previously best known for the propulsive but somewhat generic YA dystopian Maze Runner series, graduates, with honours, to the big league of Hollywood helmers. This is a top-quality summer blockbuster, bringing fresh blood and new ideas into the series while staying recognisably within the worlds so meticulously created in the previous three movies.Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is set many generations in the future, long after the events of War for the Planet of the Apes and the conclusion of the story of Caesar, who is now regarded as a Moses-like legendary figure. But the thing about legends is that they get appropriated and twisted to fit the current narrative. Wise old orangutan scholar Raka (Peter Macon) follows the word of Caesar to the letter; Proximus (Kevin Durand) cherrypicks the primate unity theme but disregards the bit about ape not killing ape.

Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes review – rip-roaring adventure from the late Yoshitaka Murayama,"Rabbit and Bear Studios; 505 Games; PC, PlayStation, Switch, XboxHead into battle with your own turbo-charged squadron in this crowd-funded Pokémonesque sequel to the the Japanese designer’s classic Suikoden seriesWhile the joyously flexible role-playing game Baldur’s Gate 3 dominated this year’s Bafta game awards, winning the award for best game, there remains a strong nostalgic appetite for plainer, more traditional RPGs. Conceived by Yoshitaka Murayama, a writer-director who made his name during the original PlayStation years, Eiyuden Chronicle raised £3.6m on Kickstarter in 2020 to become the third highest-funded video game ever on the crowdfunding site. It’s a sequel to Murayama’s classic Suikoden series in all but name: a rip-roaring adventure featuring a group of mostly young people tangled in the friction and chaos of two warring neighbouring states.As with Murayama’s work from the 90s, follows a familiar pattern as you guide your party from settlement to dungeon, your progress regularly interrupted by capricious random battles through which your characters become incrementally more powerful. After a pedestrian prologue, the game unfurls deliciously. Its gimmick is its Pokémon-esque meta-quest: to woo and recruit each of the 100 or so titular heroes to your cause. They begin as a tiny party, then develop into a squadron, to finally become a makeshift army. Every warrior, healer and member of support staff has a name, a personality and an arc. Recruits are encountered across the world. Some enrol the moment you approach; others require cajoling. But the thrill of completing the collection turbo-charges the game’s more conservative, dated appeal, as the recruits can each be slotted into your main six-person team, and directly controlled in battle.

Despite Wigmore Hall’s strictures on the use of any electronic devices, every seat was sold. The capacity audience, of all ages, sat stock still, concentrating hard, throughout. At the end they whooped and cheered and some took pictures. These three trios, written across Brahms’s lifetime, have no programme, in the sense of stories attached. The listener’s ears and mind weave their own narrative.Until a fortnight ago, any observation about the disruptive use of mobiles at concerts would have been dismissed as classical-elite fuss. After the announcement by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra’s chief executive that she was happy for phones to be used in concerts, a long thorny subject has become news. A week on, with complaints from all sides, some backtracking has taken place: dim the brightness, don’t use flash, performers’ views will be honoured, some concerts might be more appropriate than others.

Three Burials by Anders Lustgarten review – a madcap satire on the refugee crisis,"A nurse battles to give a dead Somali refugee a dignified burial as the English police set out to retrieve his body and cover up their crimeWith his debut novel, the British playwright Anders Lustgarten proves Orwell’s dictum that “to be funny, indeed, you have got to be serious”. A loud, populous, madcap satire on Britain’s broken refugee system, the novel takes on white extremism, Covid-19, the decline of the Met and the NHS, gentrification, the Home Office, the EU and migration in all its gritty, blood-soaked details. It combines political astuteness with tonal exuberance, morbid humour, situational irony and moral passion. The outcome is an irreverent, tragicomic tour de force as absurd and as urgent as hope.The novel opens with Somali pals Omar and Abdi Bile crossing to Britain from France via the English Channel. A storm rises. Their boat runs into difficulty. They pray for rescue but instead along come white supremacist cop Freddie Barratt and his impressionable protege, officer Andy Jakubiak.

"Soya, nuts and yoghurt: the diet tweaks that can ease the symptoms of menopause","It’s crucial to look after your gut microbiome. So avoid ultra-processed foods,  eat healthily, and try blueberries and beetroot for help with hot flushes tooWhen life feels chaotic, food can be a comfort, a pleasure, an uplifting ritual. Fitting in time to cook, however, can often seem like another impossible thing on the list, especially when there are differing tastes to cater for, and the demands of work to contend with. But as women enter their fourth and fifth decades, considering what we eat is crucial, and making just a few tweaks may improve our health and wellbeing.“The focus needs to be on eating well, eating a variety of foods, and foods that support bone and heart health,” says Dr Claire Phipps, GP and advanced menopause specialist. Think about a Mediterranean style of eating, with lots of oily fish, wholegrain, pulses, fruit and veg, good fats (avocado, olive oil, for example), nuts and seeds, protein and dairy (calcium is vital for supporting bone density). Good health at this stage of life really is best achieved through diet rather than supplements – “our body uses it much better”. That said, Phipps would recommend taking a vitamin D supplement, maybe magnesium, as “it can be helpful for insomnia”.

‘I did not wish to die. I was 21 … But death was choosing me’: author Richard Flanagan on the accident that nearly killed him,"The Booker prize winner was a young man kayaking a remote Tasmanian river when he became stuck at the bottom of a rapid, boulders trapping him under the water. As he became weaker, he felt himself facing his final moments …At first I thought I would escape easily. But then the river flooded into the kayak, filling it in seconds with the force of tons of rushing water, the kayak began sagging and the fibreglass behind my seat cracked. The boat folded. The front half sank to the riverbed dragging me down with it, and I felt myself disappearing beneath the rapid. Behind my back the broken stern splayed upwards towards the air, braced by the drop’s ledge, jamming the kayak in the rapid. The rounded front deck flattened onto my legs from the river’s force, trapping my knees. The overwhelming power of the water against my back pushed me up off the kayak seat so that I wasn’t sitting but hovering above it, fixed in place by my jammed, crushed legs.The river was now rolling over me. A black plume above my head transformed into a cascading flume of aerated white water beyond it with a small air pocket forming in front of my face, all that would keep me alive for several hours.

The hot years: the truth about what happens during menopause – and the best ways to get through it,"Memory blockages can be scary and hot flushes uncomfortable. But we know so much more now about what really happens in midlife. And the aftermath can be amazingMenopause was previously seen as a source of ageist shame, an unexploded bomb, or a suspicious parcel. But it is a natural phase which marks the end of childbearing years and, at last, we have the science and the knowledge to resolve a lot of the surrounding mental and physical health issues. Now is the time to embrace menopause, rather than fear it, and tackle the changes holistically.As the actor Gillian Anderson – who wrestled with an early menopause herself – once said: “Perimenopause and menopause should be treated as the rites of passage they are and, if not celebrated, then at least accepted and acknowledged and honoured.” And the aftermath can be amazing; when hormones are steady, your moods stabilise and periods have gone for ever.

Ask Ottolenghi: what can I use instead of chilli?,"You could get spicy with the ginger, garlic and onion, try flavourful but less hot varieties of chilli, or get busy with a lemon …So many recipes rely on chilli for flavour, but unfortunately it numbs my mouth and I then can’t taste anything, so it’s just an unpleasant experience. What’s a good substitute so dishes still pack a punch, but not in a painful way? Yvonne, NetherlandsJust fresh chilli or all chilli? Lots of dried chillies are much more about their smoky depth, and chocolatey, sweet notes than their kick – ancho and pasilla, for example, are wonderful. Also, if a recipe calls for chilli flakes, try red bell pepper flakes instead, or smoked paprika rather than smoky chilli: both bring the colour and depth you don’t want to miss out on, without the heat you do want to avoid.If, on the other hand, you want to replicate the punch of chilli, a combination of garlic, ginger and spring onion will get you a long way. Add them at the start of cooking and sweat gently in oil, or use as a finishing touch, much as you would a tarka: soften in a little oil, then drizzle on top. Smoked garlic is another ingredient to play around with to introduce big flavour to all sorts (while we’re on the subject of smoked ingredients, smoked salt is another great option).

Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe vegan recipe for lentils with pomegranate molasses and lemon tahini | The new vegan,"These sweet-sour lentils are beautifully offset by a whipped lemon tahini that just might become your favourite condimentThese gently sweet-and-sour lentils are great, and you should definitely make them, but the real head-turner here is the whipped lemon tahini, shown to me by plant-based chef Kali Jago – it is now my favourite condiment. In short, tahini can transform into a creamy, delicious thing, which, like mayonnaise, is neither solid or liquid, and lovely to spoon down regardless. Unlike mayonnaise, however, it is easy to make: you just need to emulsify it with water and oil by pressing the “on” button on your blender.Discover this recipe and many more from your favourite cooks on the new Guardian Feast app, with smart features to make everyday cooking easier and more fun Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/11/lentils-pomegranate-molasses-lemon-tahini-recipe-vegan-meera-sodha,2024-05-11 11:00:26,These sweet-sour lentils are beautifully offset by a whipped lemon that just might become your favourite condiment but the real head-turner here is the whipped lemon
Yotam Ottolenghi’s five-ingredient (or thereabouts) recipes,"A simple, one-tray take on Hainanese chicken rice, heady with ginger and topped with a spring onion oil, and braised broad beans in their pods with chilli and garlicSetting ourselves a five-ingredient limit on any recipe really gets the Ottolenghi test kitchen going. Well, that, or it sends us spiralling into existential doubt, not least regarding what, exactly, constitutes an ingredient. Everyone has salt and pepper, right, so we don’t need to include them in the tally? What about white pepper: is that the same? Water’s not an ingredient, either – it’s not something we need to go out and buy. But does that mean tinfoil is? Can we squeeze in olive oil on a free pass? Or garlic? And what if something is just a serving suggestion, rather than a built-in part of the recipe? How about we just put every ingredient in the title, to highlight how simple and short the ingredient list is? For a group of recipe-creating obsessives, never has counting to five felt so confusing. The results, though, I’m happy to report, are delightfully straightforward, uncomplicatedly delicious and serve (well, about) five.

Germany’s football factory: a travel guide to the Ruhr,"All eyes will be on Germany’s industrial heartland next month as Euro 2024 kicks off. We explore the region’s heritage, renewal and sporting historyIn 1961, future West German chancellor Willy Brandt declared: “The sky above the Ruhr must be blue once more.” His words were greeted with what sounded like applause but was actually his audience falling off their chairs. Because the Ruhrpott, or Ruhrgebiet, an agglomeration of industrial cities that includes Gelsenkirchen (where England will play their opening match of the European Championship this summer), Dortmund (which hosts group matches as well as a semi-final), Essen and Duisburg was a place where the chimneys of the coal, iron and steel industries poked up above the smog like candles on a giant grey birthday cake. You were more likely to slip in unicorn droppings than breathe clean air in the Ruhrpott.Today the notion of the Ruhr as a tourist destination may provoke as many German sniggers as Brandt’s prophecy back in 1961. But while this region of more than 5 million people may lack the fairytale castles of Bavaria or the coolness of Berlin, there’s plenty to divert the thousands of fans who will pour into the region in June and July. And that’s even if you leave aside the rich football heritage of the mighty Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04, and perennial battlers such as Rot-Weiss Essen, Bochum and Duisburg.

Is this a real Premier League title race or a skilfully maintained illusion? | Jonathan Liew,"<p>Intrigue, mind games and a credible chance of Manchester City slipping up are all missing from this supposedly epic battle</p><p>Hello, hello. Testing. Is this thing still on? As we head into the penultimate weekend of the Premier League season, a title race does putatively <em>appear</em> to exist. Arsenal are top, a point ahead of Manchester City. City have a game in hand. Mathematically speaking, nothing yet is decided or settled.</p><p>What remains to be seen, of course, is whether this is actually a real title race, or whether we are simply living through a skilfully maintained illusion. After all, it’s almost three months since City dropped points against anybody other than a direct title rival. They haven’t lost in the league since December and are on a run of six straight wins. Three more will be enough to retain the league title. Two will do if Arsenal slip up at&nbsp;Old&nbsp;Trafford on Sunday.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/10/premier-league-manchester-city-arsenal-pep-guardiola-mikel-arteta"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/10/premier-league-manchester-city-arsenal-pep-guardiola-mikel-arteta,2024-05-10 19:00:05

At first glance, it is possible to fall into the trap of thinking that they hit the jackpot 14 years ago. Vitesse, a Dutch club with little history of success, had their identity transformed after a takeover led by the Georgian former footballer Merab Jordania.</p><p>Allegations of links between Jordania and Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch and former owner of Chelsea Football Club, were always denied. Vitesse, whose highest finish in the Eredivisie was third in 1998, trundled along. They were characterised as “Chelsea B” because of the numbers of players they took on loan from the Premier League side. The game that brought them the first trophy in their long but modest history is instructive. Three young Chelsea loanees – Matt Miazga, Lewis Baker and Nathan – were in the Vitesse team that beat AZ Alkmaar in the Dutch Cup final in 2017.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/10/geopolitics-vitesse-arnhem-chelsea-b-roman-abramovich-associates"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/10/geopolitics-vitesse-arnhem-chelsea-b-roman-abramovich-associates,2024-05-10 14:00:19

Piers Morgan won’t care where the Baby Reindeer saga goes.

The Belgian town where families take in people with psychiatric conditions,"<p>Photojournalist Ilvy Njiokiktjien was granted rare access to document the lives of boarders and their foster families in Geel, which has a remarkable, centuries-old tradition of altruistic psychiatric care</p><p>The city of Geel in Belgium has a foster care system for people dealing with mental health issues. These foster families sometimes host their boarders for decades, making them an integral part of the nuclear family. The families see the care they provide as normal, because many know it from their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles. This system is within the DNA of Geel.</p><p>By fostering in this way the families want to normalise the lives of those with mental illness, treating them not as patients with a diagnosis, to be institutionalised, but as individuals deserving of dignity and inclusion. This way of altruistic psychiatric care has been part of Geel since the 13th century. It started when a church was built for Saint Dymphna, who is the patron saint of mental illness. Because of the construction of the church, pilgrims started flocking to the city. About 2,000 boarders were living with local farmers at that time. They helped with daily tasks. This was the beginning of the foster care system and it is still there, now spanning seven centuries.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/10/geel-belgian-town-familes-foster-people-with-psychiatric-conditions"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/10/geel-belgian-town-familes-foster-people-with-psychiatric-conditions,2024-05-10 06:00:33

Is this a real Premier League title race or a skilfully maintained illusion? | Jonathan Liew,"<p>Intrigue, mind games and a credible chance of Manchester City slipping up are all missing from this supposedly epic battle</p><p>Hello, hello. Testing. Is this thing still on? As we head into the penultimate weekend of the Premier League season, a title race does putatively <em>appear</em> to exist. Arsenal are top, a point ahead of Manchester City. City have a game in hand. Mathematically speaking, nothing yet is decided or settled.</p><p>What remains to be seen, of course, is whether this is actually a real title race, or whether we are simply living through a skilfully maintained illusion. After all, it’s almost three months since City dropped points against anybody other than a direct title rival. They haven’t lost in the league since December and are on a run of six straight wins. Three more will be enough to retain the league title. Two will do if Arsenal slip up at&nbsp;Old&nbsp;Trafford on Sunday.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/10/premier-league-manchester-city-arsenal-pep-guardiola-mikel-arteta"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/10/premier-league-manchester-city-arsenal-pep-guardiola-mikel-arteta,2024-05-10 19:00:05

‘Punching up against colonialism is glorious!’ The unstoppable rise of Indian comedy in the UK,"<p>Standup has enjoyed a rapid rise in India over the last decade, and now its leading lights are conquering the Edinburgh fringe and packing out the Royal Albert Hall. Where better to take aim at the legacy of Empire …</p><p>In the summer of 2010, Anuvab&nbsp;Pal was writing an&nbsp;article about the opening of&nbsp;the Comedy Store in Mumbai, impresario Don Ward’s attempt to introduce British-style standup to India. Pal, then working primarily as a screenwriter, went to interview Ward, whose storied&nbsp;London venue was a cradle of&nbsp;alternative comedy in the 1980s. He&nbsp;told Pal that press coverage was all&nbsp;well and good, but what he really needed was performers. The initial plan – flying British comics out to India&nbsp;– would be too costly to maintain long-term, which meant he had to find talent, fast. Would Pal audition for him?</p><p>Pal agreed but remained sceptical. “I remember telling my family: ‘This is just a little hobby, I don’t think English comedy’s going to pick up in India,’” he recalls. “Fourteen years later here we are chatting. I still wake up every morning thinking: ‘This is going to end, obviously.’”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/may/10/indian-standup-comedy-anuvab-pal-kanan-gill-urooj-ashfaq-sapan-verma-vir-das-"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/may/10/indian-standup-comedy-anuvab-pal-kanan-gill-urooj-ashfaq-sapan-verma-vir-das-,2024-05-10 13:00:07

Kings of Leon: Can We Please Have Fun review – polished but tired,"<p>(Polydor)<br>The Nashville rockers still sound great, but their lyrics seem bereft of ideas</p><p>C<em>an We Please Have Fun </em>is such a horrible phrase. It adheres to the Nashville rockers’ favoured five-syllable album title structure, if that’s important to you, but is prickly and passive-aggressive coming from four middle-aged men. Its intended message feels like inane boosterism given the state of the world; further proof of the quartet’s unending insularity. And why should rock be fun anyway? Kings of Leon’s best songs – Knocked Up, Milk, Closer – are shadowed by death or loss.</p><p>The good news is that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stxTjxtbDug"">Caleb Followill</a> retains one of the great rock voices, a yearning, brittle, whiskey-brined caw that’s richer than ever.

Dehd: Poetry review – a sparkling dialogue with rock’n’roll history,"<p><strong>(Fat Possum Records)<br></strong>The Chicago trio go back in time and dip into big-chorused Americana, slacker indie and vintage soul – all with real feeling</p><p>Chicago <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/27/dehd-blue-skies-review-jason-bella-emily-kempf"">rock band Dehd’s music</a> is two things: mercilessly catchy and meticulously camp. The trio’s biggest hit to date – 2022’s Bad Love – was a smoke machine-fogged rush of instant-singalong glam. Now, their fifth album arrives in a swirl of bratty pop-punk: opener Dog Days’ stop-start guitars accompany pouty playground-chant lyrics dripping with teenage melodrama. Later, they turn to sweeping, big-chorused Americana (Hard to Love), combine slacker indie and vintage soul for the irresistible Mood Ring – a sleazy, cheesy tale of unexpectedly reciprocated lust – and, on Necklace, cleverly meld country and grunge, the exaggerated scuzz offsetting sugary-sweet melodic hooks.</p><p>Contemporary guitar music is in constant, unavoidable conversation with the past, and Dehd inject a lot of fun into this dialogue. There’s a knowingness in the band’s dressing-up-box approach to genres past, and a distance, too; Poetry often feels as if it has a sepia filter (it comes as little surprise to find Whitney’s Ziyad Asrar on production duties; a band who helped pioneer this kind of faux-retro feel).</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/10/dehd-poetry-review"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/10/dehd-poetry-review,2024-05-10 07:30:06

Wide jeans and a hoodie is a super-simple formula that works,"<p>The baggier leg shape is essential, so that the top and bottom halves mirror each other</p><p>It is useful to have a few tried-and-tested formulas you can rely on for those times when you need an outfit that just works. Think of them like the wardrobe equivalent of your go-to recipes. When you get home from work hungry, you need a few quick and easy dinner ideas in your back pocket so that when you open the&nbsp;fridge you don’t need to think too&nbsp;hard. Same goes for clothes.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong. I love to open my wardrobe with no preconceived idea of what I am going to wear and put&nbsp;an outfit together on a whim – but no way do I want to do that every day. That would be exhausting. Again, it’s a bit like making dinner. You may be a keen cook who loves to try out new recipes, but that doesn’t mean you want to be rummaging around at the back of the store cupboard for gochujang or date molasses every night. Sometimes your brain needs a&nbsp;break and you want to get dressed, or&nbsp;make dinner, on autopilot.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/may/10/wide-jeans-and-a-hoodie-is-a-super-simple-formula-that-works"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/may/10/wide-jeans-and-a-hoodie-is-a-super-simple-formula-that-works,2024-05-10 09:00:09
From the Met Gala to your Instagram feed: how ugly beauty took over fashion,"<p>In this week’s newsletter: Celebs at this year’s spectacle appeared to reject standardised versions of beauty – mirroring a wider shift to experimentation.

Her dress was soaked and streaks of mascara streamed down her face. The look, which turned out to be the work of makeup artist Pat McGrath, has since gone viral.</p><p>The American rapper wasn’t the only one to veer away from traditional red carpet beauty that night. Actor Amanda Seyfried dyed her blond hair grey and, rather than the traditional red, her lips were a lurid purple, the colour of verbena. Zendaya, who walked the carpet not once but twice, wore her eyebrows so pencil-thin that they almost disappeared.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/may/09/fashion-statement-met-gala-trend-ugly-beauty"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/may/09/fashion-statement-met-gala-trend-ugly-beauty,2024-05-10 11:00:06

"Apple Butter Cafe, London W1: ‘Food to make a diabetes doctor sigh anxiously’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants","<p>When the world isn’t particularly sweet, sometimes we all need a sharp blast of teeth-chattering, sugary goo …</p><p><a href=""https://applebuttercafe.com/"">Apple Butter Cafe</a>, which recently opened a second branch at the top of London’s Regent Street, is very much a cafe of its time. Today’s young may be eschewing the vices of yesteryear – booze, ciggies, drugs, etc – but their Achilles heel is sugar. Build a cafe that serves short stacks of chunky, fat pancakes smothered in banoffee syrup and topped with mini meringues, shards of tempered chocolate, quenelles of thick cream and microplaned lemon zest, and they will come. Post a video on TikTok of someone blowtorching said pancake stack, so the meringue browns and gives the whole hot mess a baked alaska vibe, however, and your customers will queue from 8am for the chance to make their own content next to the fake plastic trees “growing” inside the cafe.</p><p>Sugar is the most cheerily pernicious of vices. I come from a long line of bingo-winged, eccles cake-addicted Methodist women who wear smock dresses, so I am condemned by my DNA to seek out plentiful bowls of apple crumble pancakes with spiced fruit. No calories are printed on Apple Butter Cafe’s menu – not on the creme brulee french toast nor the croissant butter pudding with custard and pecan nuts. Both dishes, I suspect, would make a diabetes doctor sigh anxiously. That said, one benefit of Apple Butter Cafe’s new Langham Place branch is that it is a mere hop, skip and jump from Harley Street, though those in the medical profession may well see “hopping” as your destiny after too much vanilla cheesecake or saffron milk cake in a custardy puddle strewn with petals.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/10/apple-butter-cafe-london-w1-grace-dent-restaurant-review"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/10/apple-butter-cafe-london-w1-grace-dent-restaurant-review,2024-05-10 11:00:04
Ravneet Gill’s gluten-free strawberry meringue cake – recipe | The sweet spot,"<p>A strawberry and cream sandwich cake with crushed meringue for some welcome crunch</p><p>This celebratory sponge makes everyone feel special. And, unlike the sometimes arduous task of baking a birthday cake, it can be put together really quickly. Two speedy sponges are sandwiched together not with a buttercream but simply with broken-up meringues and whipped cream.

Why not try a wine you’ve never heard of? | Fiona Beckett on drink,"<p>Who is buying the more obscure wines, and where can you get them?</p><p>These days, it seems, the more obscure and unpronounceable a wine is, the better. True, this is a trend that’s been going on for a while, with both Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose in competition with their spookily similar <a href=""https://www.marksandspencer.com/l/wine-shop/wine-beer-and-spirits/found-range"">Found</a> and <a href=""https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/shop/browse/groceries/beer_wine_and_spirits/wine/waitrose_and_partners_wine/loved_and_found"">Loved &amp; Found</a> ranges, and they’ve now been joined by Sainsbury’s Discovery and Aldi’s Unearthed.</p><p>So who is buying these bottles, and why are the supermarkets doing them? Because the other concurrent trend seems to be to give the customer more of the same, whatever it is – sauvignon blanc, malbec or prosecco. “Indigenous varieties can be an exciting way of innovating in wine, but have always been harder to sell,” Waitrose’s head wine buyer Pierpaolo Petrassi tells me, and explains that the Loved &amp; Found range is a way to let more adventurous customers – the kind who would also buy more experimental food ranges – try new and unusual wines.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href=""https://fionabeckett.substack.com/"">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/10/why-not-try-a-wine-youve-never-heard-of-fiona-beckett"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/10/why-not-try-a-wine-youve-never-heard-of-fiona-beckett,2024-05-10 13:00:06
I’m ignored when I try to chat to people. How can I improve my conversation skills? | Ask Annalisa Barbieri,"<p>Fruitful exchanges require input from two people.

I can only ever communicate factual information such as “A coffee and a croissant, please.”</strong></p><p><strong>Other people seem to rattle on about anything and everything, constantly jumping from one </strong><strong>topic to another, but I can never follow. If I ever feel that I have something to contribute and try to join in they simply ignore me or change the subject.
